# Programmable system of shade control
„Programmable system of shade control” is a mobile application working with microcontroler which general purpose is to control a shade in a few ways. 
Our goal was to create a project that would make one of our daily activities a little bit easier by letting us control wireless things that all of us have in a home. 
The main inspiration for this was, of course, the increasing number of smart home solutions, the systems where more and more things can be done directly from a smartphone.
